Consider the following class:

public class IdentifyMyParts {
    public static int x = 7; 
    public int y = 3; 
}
What are the class variables? -> X 

What are the instance variables? -> Y

What is the output from the following code:

IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
a.y = 5; //Put 5 on a.y 
b.y = 6; //put 6 on b.y
a.x = 1; //static - same for both set to 1 
b.x = 2; // Set to 2 for both classes
System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y); //a.y = 5
System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y); //b.y = 6
System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x); //a.x = 2
System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x); //b.x = 2 
System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x);	//idmyp = 2
