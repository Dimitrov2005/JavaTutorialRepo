1. What methods would a class that implements the java.lang.CharSequence interface have to implement?
Any methods that do not provide default method implementation:
charAt(), length(), subSequence(), toString()


2. What is wrong with the following interface?
public interface SomethingIsWrong {
    void aMethod(int aValue){
        System.out.println("Hi Mom");
    }
}
The Method is not stated as default, there will be a compilation error.


3. Fix the interface in question 2.
default void aMethod(int aValue){ sout.....}


4. Is the following interface valid?
public interface Marker {}

yes, empty interface is valid
