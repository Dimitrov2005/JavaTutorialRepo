Operators may be used in building expressions, which compute values.
Expressions are the core components of statements.
Statements may be grouped into blocks.
The following code snippet is an example of a ambigious expression.
 1 * 2 * 3

Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages, but instead of ending with a period, a statement ends with a semicolumn.
A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced parenthessis{} and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.

Identify the following kinds of expression statements:

aValue = 8933.234; value assignment statement
aValue++; value increment statement
System.out.println("Hello World!"); method invocation statement 
Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle(); object creation statement
