1.Use the API documentation to find the answers to the following questions:

    What Integer method can you use to convert an int into a string that expresses the number in hexadecimal?
    For example, what method converts the integer 65 into the string "41"?
    static String	toHexString(int i)

    What Integer method would you use to convert a string expressed in base 5 into the equivalent int?
     For example, how would you convert the string "230" into the integer value 65? Show the code you would use to accomplish this task.
           Integer intbase1 = Integer.parseInt("230", 5);
    What Double method can you use to detect whether a floating-point number has the special value Not a Number (NaN)?
           static boolean	isNaN(double v)

2. What is the value of the following expression, and why?
    Integer.valueOf(1).equals(Long.valueOf(1))
        value is false because Long is not an Integer


1. What is the initial capacity of the following string builder?

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Able was I ere I saw Elba.");
sb.length + 16

2. Consider the following string:
String hannah = "Did Hannah see bees? Hannah did.";
What is the value displayed by the expression hannah.length()?
32, in C - 33

What is the value returned by the method call hannah.charAt(12)?
e
Write an expression that refers to the letter b in the string referred to by hannah.
hannah.charAt(15) - starting from 0

3. How long is the string returned by the following expression? What is the string?

"Was it a car or a cat I saw?".substring(9, 12)
car

In the following program, called ComputeResult, what is the value of result after each numbered line executes?

public class ComputeResult {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String original = "software";
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder("hi");
        int index = original.indexOf('a');

/*1*/   result.setCharAt(0, original.charAt(0));
/*2*/   result.setCharAt(1, original.charAt(original.length()-1));
/*3*/   result.insert(1, original.charAt(4));
/*4*/   result.append(original.substring(1,4));
/*5*/   result.insert(3, (original.substring(index, index+2) + " "));

        System.out.println(result); -> swear oft
    }
}
