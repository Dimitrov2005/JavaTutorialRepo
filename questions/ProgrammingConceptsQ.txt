Real-world objects contain state and behavior.
A software object's state is stored in object fields.
A software object's behavior is exposed through object methods.
Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly exposed methods is known as data encapsulation.
A blueprint for a software object is called a class.
Common behavior can be defined in a parrent class and inherited into a child class using the extends keyword.
A collection of methods with no implementation is called an interface.
A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a package.
The term API stands for Application Programming Interface?
